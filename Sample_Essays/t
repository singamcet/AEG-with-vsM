Intelligent Machines

Many of the goods and servaces we depend on daily are now supplied by intelligent, automated machines rather than human beings.

We can now buy goods at a variety of stores without the help of a human cashier. Automation is generally seen as a sign of progress, but what is lost when we replace humans with machines? Given the accelerating variety and prevalence of intelligent machines, it is worth examining the implications and meaning of their presence in our lives
